# Supercontinuum-Generation-Waveform-prediction-with-RNN
We propose an RNN-based deep learning model to predict supercontinuum bandwidth in chalcogenide–silica PCFs. It removes the need for COMSOL–MATLAB simulations, achieving MSE ≈ 0.00078 and enabling fast, accurate SCG modeling in complex photonic crystal fiber designs.
