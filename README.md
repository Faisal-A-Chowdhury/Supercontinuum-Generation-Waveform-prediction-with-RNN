ðŸ§  Supercontinuum Generation Waveform Prediction using RNN
We present a novel deep learning framework for predicting supercontinuum spectral bandwidth in chalcogenideâ€“silica hybrid photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), bypassing the need for conventional COMSOLâ€“MATLAB simulations. This model leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, trained from scratch, to accurately map the nonlinear spectral broadening phenomena induced by ultrashort laser pulses.

Traditional simulation pipelines involving Finite Element Method (FEM) for mode analysis and Generalized Nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger Equation (GNLSE) for supercontinuum modeling are computationally expensive. Our RNN-based approach eliminates these steps and achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of just 0.00078784, offering both high precision and significant reduction in computation time.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of RNNs in modeling SCG within complex PCF structures. The model is especially effective in scenarios involving non-trivial dispersion profiles, mid-IR bandwidths, and chalcogenide materials where conventional methods become impractical or slow.
